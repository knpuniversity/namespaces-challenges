        Everyone at the office is *starving*, but you want to
        master namespaces before celebrating with lunch.

        This `Pizza` class looks great. But now, give the
        class a namespace - `Food\Tasty`. Then, update `eat.php`
        to work, but **without** adding a `use` statement.

        Everyone is starving, and depending on you!

        Next, see if you can add a `use` statement

        Check out this `Koala` class:

        ```php
        namespace Animal\Adorable;

        class Koala
        {
        }
        ```

        And this code that uses it:

        ```php
        $koala = new \Animal\Adorable\Koala();
        ```

        Is that first slash in `\Animal\Adorable\Koala` necessary?
    explanation: >
        With no opening slash, PHP thinks you are referring to a
        class that is in the current file's namespace *plus* this
        namespace. For example:

        ```php
        // namespaced_file.php
        namespace Zoo;

        $koala = new Animal\Adorable\Koala();
        // "Class not found Zoo\Animal\Adorable\Koala"
        ```php
        // no_namespace.php
        $koala = new \Animal\Adorable\Koala();
        // This works!
        ```

        Most of the time you should have a `use` statement anyways,
        But if you use the full namespace, it's much safer to
        include the opening slash: that will *always* work.

                    Yes. If you choose to not have a `use` statement,
                    then you must always start with a `\` so that PHP knows
                    to build the namespace from the *root* of all namespaces.
                b: >
                    No. The slash is always optional, and really redundant:
                    PHP knows that you are looking for a class from the root of
                    the namespace.

                    It depends on whether or not this file lives in a namespace.

        The intern is messing around and has changed the `use`
        statement for `Pizza` to use an alias: `ItalianTreat`. Without
        changing that line, update the `new` line so that the
        code runs using the new alias.

        After lunch, the whole team is happily coding with
        namespaces and `use` statements. Suddenly, someone
        sees an error and calls you over for help! Can you
        fix this code?

        P.S. This is the *most* common mistake when using namespaces.
